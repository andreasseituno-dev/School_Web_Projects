# School_Web_Projects  
Collection of web development projects from my first two semesters of high school.  

These projects were created during my **Technical Course in Systems Development** to practice and improve my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

As part of my coursework, I was challenged to build small websites within **1 to 3 hours**. All of them were graded assignments for the subjects:  

- **Development 1** (*Desenvolvimento 1*)  
- **Development of Dynamic Applications** (*Desenvolvimento de AplicaÃ§Ãµes DinÃ¢micas*)
